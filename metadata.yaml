description: As one of the leaders of the influential New Thought movement, author
  William Walker Atkinson had an unshakable belief in the power of the human mind
  -- and he was convinced that most of us fail to fully tap into its remarkable capabilities.
  Your Mind and How to Use It offers an interesting overview of the basic principles
  of what Atkinson calls ""practical psychology,"" including actionable tips and techniques
  to begin to make use of the innate powers of the human mind.
